// credentials and no shared database. It implements exactly the command surface lib/kv.ts
// uses - if kv.ts starts using a new command, the fake throws rather than silently returning
// undefined, which is what you want: a missing command should fail loudly in a test run.
//
// Upstash semantics worth preserving, because kv.ts depends on them:
//   - `get` JSON-parses stored strings; values set as objects come back as objects.
//   - `mget` returns null (not undefined) for missing keys.
//   - lists are stored newest-first via lpush, which is how history keys are written.
